<font size="4.5" color="gray"> <p align="justify">I am currently working as a data science lead at Cars.com, Inc. in Chicago, IL. I focus on building the next generation dealer churn/retention and image processing engine across multiple verticals. I also work in conjunction with the production team to build the next-generation scalable cloud computing platform.</p>
</p>
<p align="justify">Before joining Cars.com, I was a data scientist lead at Uptake Technologies, Inc. My focus was on predictive condition monitoring and anomaly detection engine using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.</p>
</p>
<p align="justify">I completed my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in the summer of 2015. My Ph.D. research included DFT calculations, Photocathode Material Design, Anomaly Detection, Condition Monitoring, Signal Processing, Multivariate Statistics Modeling, Advanced Mechanics Modeling, and Machine Learning Applications. In addition to my Ph.D. degree, I also have three Master's degrees in Statistics, Applied Math, and Physics from UIC, respectively.</p>
